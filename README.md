# Student Directory #

The student-directory script allows the user to manage the list of students enrolled at the Villains Academy.


## How to use ##
This project contains a series of files chronologically and logically ordered to reflect the progress from the simplest of the files (as created by following the MA tutorial) to the most complex (as the last files created by providing my own solution to the exercises in chapter 14 of the tutorial).

One decision I have taken was instead of using the same file directory.rb and updated it under the same name and commit/push it, I chose to create new files for each exercise and commit and push those. This was in order to provide a simpler and more visible way to describe progress through the tutorial and the exercises, rather than depend on the list of commit on GitHub to show my progress.

Thus the first file directory.rb covers the chapters 1 to 7 in the tutorial (progress on these can be seen on the commits only), while the rest of the files (with directory_ch4_ex8.rb being the last one) cover the rest of the tutorial and the exercises.
